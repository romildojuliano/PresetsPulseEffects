# PresetsPulseEffects
New presets for PulseEffects (ONLY FOR LINUX)

After installing PulseEffects on Linux, move the listed presets to the folder ~/.var/app/com.github.wwmm.pulseeffects/config/PulseEffects 

Presets:

##Bass Boosted - Low Mid: 
As the name says, it has an *improved bass* as the mid tones decreases to not interfere too much on the sound quality in general; The high tones are a little bit oversaturated, some ajusts would make it better! Any changes to improve this preset could be attempted and sent to me
