# New Presets for PulseEffects
New presets for PulseEffects (provided by WWMM)

## How to install PulseEffects
The complete tutorial for installation of PulseEffects can be provided by its owner at: https://github.com/wwmm/pulseeffects

A quick way to install on **Ubuntu (or derivates) >= 18.04** or **Mint >= 19** is:
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mikhailnov/pulseeffects -y
sudo apt update
sudo apt install pulseeffects pulseaudio --install-recommends
```
Be sure after installation, **you must reboot or logout**, because there's a bug who doesn't allow the program to start!

## Adding the new presets

After installing PulseEffects on Linux, move the listed presets to the following folder:
```
~/.var/app/com.github.wwmm.pulseeffects/config/PulseEffects 
```
## Presets Available

### Bass Boosted - Low Mid: 

As the name says, it has an **improved bass** as the mid tones decreases to not interfere too much on the sound quality in general; **The high tones are a little bit oversaturated**, some ajusts would make it better! 


##### Any changes to improve this preset could be attempted and sent to me :)
